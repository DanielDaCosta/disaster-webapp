# Multi Label Text Classifier Project
The project consists of a Multi-Label Text Classifier project using a Random Forest Classifier with MultiOuputClassifier from Scikit-learn.

The dataset consists of disaster messages that are classified into 36 different classes. The goal of the model is to classify an input message into these different classes.

A Web Application was developped allowing to analyze the dataset and write your own message to be classified.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of disaster messages that are classified into 36 different classes. The dataset in highly imbalanced, having different distributions for each class. In order to reduce this problem a class weighted approach was used, where we make the classifier aware of the imbalanced data by incorporating the weights of classes into the cost function.

In the **Random Forest** model, the parameter *class_weight* was set to *'balanced'*, using the values of y to automatically adjust weights inversely proportional to class frequencies in the input data

## Usage

- data/ : ETL folder. Data preparation. To load the data from scratch:

```python process_data.py disaster_messages.csv disaster_categories.csv DisasterResponse.db ```

- models/ : Machine Learning models. To train the model:

```python train_classifier.py ../data/DisasterResponse.db classifier.pkl```

- app/ : Contains the scripts for the web application. In order to run de application go into the app/ folder an run the command:

``` python run.py```

## Installation

```
pip install -r requirements.py
```
## Development
Other models architetures were also explored. You can check the solution for the same problem using **RNN with keras** in this other GitHub Repo: [Multi-Label Text classification problem with Keras](https://github.com/DanielDaCosta/RNN-Keras/blob/master/ML-Pipeline-RNN.ipynb)
